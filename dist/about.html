            <p>I'm a student at Lut University. I'm studing Bachelor's in Technology and Engineeering Science. I have developed a wide array of useful skills while working on the web. I am passionate about developing web. I have dream to be a professional web designer. Web designers plan, create and code internet sites and web pages, many of which combine text with sounds, pictures, graphics and video clips. A web designer is responsible for creating the design and layout of a website or web pages. It and can mean working on a brand new website or updating an already existing site. The term Web Designer is often incorrectly interchanged with the term Web Developer and vice versa. A web developer is often more likely to be a software developer who works with programming languages to create a higher level of interactions on a website such as the integration with a database system.The term Web Designer is often incorrectly interchanged with the term Web Developer and vice versa.
